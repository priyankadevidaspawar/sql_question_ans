    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases. \n",
    "ans. \n",
    "What is a Database?\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, updating, and management. It serves as a central repository for information that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are used in various applications, ranging from simple record-keeping systems to complex data management systems supporting large-scale applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of databases: SQL (Structured Query Language) databases and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "Structure: SQL databases are relational databases, which means they use a predefined schema to define the structure of the data. The data is organized into tables with rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established using keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases have a fixed schema, meaning the structure of the database is defined before the data is inserted. Any changes to the schema often require careful planning and can be complex, especially in large databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases are generally vertically scalable, meaning you can increase the capacity of a single server by increasing things like CPU, RAM, or SSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "Structure: NoSQL databases can be non-relational or distributed databases. They are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and allow for more flexibility in data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: NoSQL databases are schema-less or have a dynamic schema, allowing you to insert data without first defining its structure. This flexibility is advantageous in scenarios where the data structure evolves rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are typically horizontally scalable, meaning you can add more servers to your NoSQL database to handle larger loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Structure: SQL databases use a tabular structure with rows and columns, while NoSQL databases can have various data models, including document-oriented, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, or graph-based structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases have a fixed schema, and any changes to it may be complex. NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema, allowing for more flexibility in handling evolving data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are generally horizontally scalable, making it easier to handle large amounts of data by adding more servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Language: SQL databases use SQL as a standard query language. NoSQL databases use various query languages, depending on the database type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases: SQL databases are often used for applications where the data structure is well-defined and unlikely to change frequently. NoSQL databases are suitable for applications with rapidly changing or unpredictable data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing between SQL and NoSQL depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the application being developed. Each type has its advantages and is better suited for certain use cases."

    "ans.\n",
    "*DDL (Data Definition Language):\n",
    "\n",
    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, and it is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that deals with the definition and management of database structures. DDL commands are used to define, modify, and remove the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, and schemas. The primary DDL commands include CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 CREATE:\n",
    "The CREATE command is used to create a new database object, such as a table, view, index, or schema. It specifies the name of the object, its attributes, and any constraints that should be applied.\n",
    "-- Create a new table named 'employees'\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    first_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    last_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    hire_date DATE\n",
    ");\n",
    "In this example, the CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a table named 'employees' with columns for employee ID, first name, last name, and hire date.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 DROP:\n",
    "The DROP command is used to remove an existing database object, such as a table, view, or index, from the database. Be cautious when using DROP, as it permanently deletes the specified object and its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "-- Drop the 'employees' table\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the DROP TABLE statement is used to remove the 'employees' table from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 ALTER:\n",
    "The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or deleting columns from a table or modifying the data type of a column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "-- Add a new column 'email' to the 'employees' table\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the ALTER TABLE statement is used to add a new column named 'email' to the existing 'employees' table.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 TRUNCATE:\n",
    "The TRUNCATE command is used to remove all rows from a table, but it retains the structure of the table for future use. It is faster than the DELETE command because it does not log individual row deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "-- Remove all rows from the 'employees' table\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the TRUNCATE TABLE statement is used to remove all rows from the 'employees' table, leaving the table structure intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "These DDL commands are essential for managing the structure of a database and ensuring that it meets the requirements of the application. They are powerful tools that should be used with caution, especially in a production environment, to avoid unintended data loss or schema modifications.\n"

    "2 UPDATE:\n",
    "The UPDATE command is used to modify existing records in a table. It allows you to change the values of one or more columns based on a specified condition.\n",

    "3 DELETE:\n",

    "Example:\n",

They allow for the insertion of new records, updating existing records, and deletion of records based on specified criteria.

    "ans. \n",
    "Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a field or a set of fields in a database table that uniquely identifies each record in that table. It serves as a unique identifier and must have a unique value for each record in the table. The primary key is used to enforce entity integrity in a relational database, ensuring that each record can be uniquely identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a primary key:\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column (or columns) must be unique across all records in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-null: The primary key cannot have a null (empty) value, as it must uniquely identify each record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Permanence: Ideally, a primary key value should remain constant over the lifetime of a record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single or Composite: A primary key can consist of a single column or a combination of multiple columns, known as a composite key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of creating a table with a primary key:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE students (\n",

    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a link between the data in two tables, creating a relationship between them. The foreign key in one table typically references the primary key in another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a foreign key:\n",

    "Referential Integrity: A foreign key ensures referential integrity, meaning that values in the foreign key column must match values in the primary key of the referenced table or be null.\n",

    "Relationship: It represents a relationship between two tables, usually indicating that the values in the foreign key column correspond to the primary key values in another table.\n",

    "Helps Maintain Consistency: Foreign keys help maintain data consistency by preventing the creation of \"orphaned\" rows, i.e., rows in a child table that do not have a corresponding entry in the parent table.\n",
